## Purpose of the experiment: 
The purpose of the West Research Campus experiment is to observe the disturbance influenced by the environment.

## Background Info:
Located at ECU’s West Research Campus (WRC), the experiment was originally designed to examine the effects of nutrient addition and disturbance on plant communities. This long-term experiment tests the effects of fertilization, mowing, and their interaction on wetland community diversity and function in an array of eight 20 × 30 m blocks. Students collected annual plant community data from this site and tested hypotheses of their own design using the cumulative data set. 

## Experimental Design: 
The WRC experimental design objective is to observe how organisms are influenced and can be influenced by their environment.
- Treatment (4 replicate blocks)
- There are 2 levels of fertilizer, 2 levels of hydrology and 2 levels of mowing.
- Mowing and raking takes place once per year.
- Fertilization and NPK occurs three times a year.

## Task List: 
1. Install packages
2. Seperated the WRC Plant Diversity into the years 2004 and 2013
  a. These were saved as csv files named data2004 and data2013
3. The head of each data file was curated which divides each data set into the following categories: Treatment, N. Species, N. Individuals, Sharron-Wiener Index (H’), Hmax, and EH. 
4. The csv files were then further broken down to analyze the mean stem count of N species (species data) and N individuals (indi data). 
5. A graph was then created to display the mean number of species within the year 2004 and 2013. 
6. A graph was then created to display the mean number of individuals within the year 2004 and 2013. 
7. A data summary analysis was performed on the data csv files from the year 2004 and 2013.
8. An anova was produced for the years 2004 and 2013. 
9. The statistics from the anovas were then used to perform a one-tailed t-test. 
10. The overall data was then analyzed to formulate a conclusion for the experimental procedure. 

## Conclusion: 
Number of species capable of growing a stem decreased from 2004 to 2013. 
  - 2004: N min/N max (19.00/43.00) Mean (29.84)
  - 2013: N min/N max (6.00/29.00) Mean (18.25) 

The overall stem count also decreased from 2004 to 2013.
  - 2004:N min/N max (810.00/1694.00) Mean (1120.6)
  - 2013:N min/N max (103.00/1225.00) Mean (548.1)
 
The data procured indicates a decrease in plant diversity and population. It is to be noted that certain treatments (C/F) have a greater impact than others (M/MF) and that there could be possible remediation if plots were mowed or mowed and fertilized. 

## Improvements for Future Studies
- Analyze data that covers years 2005-2012, as well as more recent years (2014-2022).
- Include broader variables to determine the shift in the mean stem length.
- Organize data in a way that allows for easier configuration.
